### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Karol but friends call me Dwarf.

I'm a front-end developer who loves the process of software designing. I like to reverse engineer larger apps to understand how they work. 

I'm looking for my first job where I can learn more from a team of Senior developers.

I'm currently learning Next.js :D
